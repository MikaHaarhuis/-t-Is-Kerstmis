 't Is Kerstmis

All my life, I tried to do what's right
First star I see tonight, make my wish come true
Why can't we, join hands around one tree
Let live and let it be
Make Christmas last forever

When Santa's flying in his magic sleigh
Goes all around the world in just a day
From the North Pole to the southern tip
He makes his trip with love to give away
Here him say....

't is Kerstmis, 't is Kerstmis
't is Kerstmis overal
Het is al lang geleden
Maar nog is er geen vrede
Dus wensen wij elkaar
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
